# Korean-News-Political-Opinion-Predictor

## Introduction

Hello! AI Ìå¨ Ïó¨Îü¨Î∂Ñ, ÌôòÏòÅÌï©ÎãàÎã§! This is my first 'big' project. This project was created to explore and enhance my coding skills in Python. I've been self-learning Python and with the aid of AI tools, I've gained a better understanding of how Machine Learning models operate. Motivated by my undergraduate studies, I aimed to apply this knowledge practically. The core of this project involves analyzing Korean news articles to classify them based on their political orientation and level of pro-government sentiment.

The objective was to train a model, specifically a RoBERTa model, to predict the political orientation of a news article. Additionally, I performed data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.

We utilized the **KoPolitics-Benchmark** dataset available [here](https://github.com/Kdavid2355/KoPolitic-Benchmark-Dataset/tree/main) and fine-tuned a RoBERTa model from Hugging Face ü§ó, which can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/klue/roberta-base).

## Results

The Korean News Political Opinion Predictor achieved promising results in classifying political orientation and pro-government sentiment of Korean news articles. Here are some highlights from the data analysis and model predictions:

- **Political Orientation Analysis:**
  - The model was able to categorize news articles into five distinct political orientations: Conservative, Moderate Conservative, Moderate, Moderate Liberal, and Liberal.
  - The distribution of political orientations in our test set showed a significant number of articles classified as Moderate (42.91%) and Moderate Liberal (27.84%), indicating a prevalence of centrist views in the sampled news.

- **Government Sentiment Analysis:**
  - The level of pro-government sentiment was also analyzed, ranging from 'None' to 'Strong Advocacy'.
  - The majority of articles exhibited 'None' (40.71%), indicating a neutral stance towards the government, followed by moderate criticism (19.78%).

- **Interactive Analysis:**
  - The web application, equipped with a Streamlit interface available in both English and Korean, makes it accessible to a broader audience.
  - Users can explore the political landscape of media by selecting articles from a dropdown list. Upon selection, the application not only displays the content of the article but also visualizes the model‚Äôs predicted political orientation and the true political orientation using color-coded results.
  - These color visualizations offer an intuitive way to compare predictions against actual orientations, thereby illustrating the nuanced landscape of media perspectives and enhancing the user's understanding of the model's performance.

   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
   - Run the following command to clone the project:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/mathilddadda/Korean-News-Political-Opinion-Predictor.git
     ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd Korean-News-Political-Opinion-Predictor
     ```
   - Install the required Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## How to Run
In the same Korean-News-Political-Opinion-Predictor folder, run the following command, which will launch a window in your browser shwoing a nice tool to select articles and view my model's prediction:
```bash
streamlit -run web_visualization.py
```
